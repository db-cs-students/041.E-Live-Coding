## üìù Editing You Code

You will need to open your repository in Gitpod which is an IDE that runs in your browser. This is exactly the same setup we will use for future development, so it's good to get familiar with it now.

To open your respository, prefix the url for this repository with `gitpod.io/#`.

## üß™ Testing Your Code

Run the code with `yarn start`. This will launch Expo and you will see a QR code that will allow you to open the running app on your phone. You will need the Expo Client App.
